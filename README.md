## LED Fade
I wired a metro board express to get an LED to fade in and out by using curcuit python. I had difficulties with this assignment just because I had never used curcuit python before and figureing it out was difficult, especially the duty cycles. 

## Servo 
The goal of this assignment was to have a Servo sweep from 180 to 0 degrees using two wires to control the movements dirrection and when the wires are touched. This assignment was pretty simple with the exeption of pulsio which was a new and slightly difficult concept for me to grasp.
